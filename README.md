# Reading Task 01 - REST

By Michael Due (cph-mp447)

## Exercise

In year 2000, the software engineer and researcher Roy Fielding (https://roy.gbiv.com/) published his PhD thesis (https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm), entitled Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures, in which he introduced and defined the concept behind the now so popular abbreviation REST.

Read the document and find out the answers of the following questions:

1. What exactly is REST? How does the context of it fits to the title of the dissertation?

2. Why is the dissertation considered so important for the software-architectural world?

3. Which is the most valuable outcome you personally get from it?

4. How could you implement it in your own practice as a software developer?

Submit the answers in Peergrade and read the answers of at least three of your colleagues, to validate your and their vision.

This task is individual and brings you five credits.

## Answers

#### 1. What exactly is REST? How does the context of it fits to the title of the dissertation?

REST stand for Representational State Transfer.

REST is a hybrid style derived from several of the network-based architectural styles and combined with additional constraints that define a uniform connector interface.

REST is also an architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems, and has been developed to represent the model for how the modern Web should work. REST provides a set of architectural constraints that, when applied as a whole, emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems.

In the dissertation REST is compared to the constraints of other architectural styles. 

#### 2. Why is the dissertation considered so important for the software-architectural world?

The dissertation defines a framework for understanding software architecture via architectural styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the architectural design of network-based application software. 

The Internet Engineering Taskforce defined the existing Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.0) and design the extensions for the new standards of HTTP/1.1 and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI), Roy recognized the need for a model of how the World Wide Web (WWW) should work. This idealized model of the interactions within an overall Web application, referred to as the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style, became the foundation for the modern Web architecture, providing the guiding principles by which flaws in the preexisting architecture could be identified and extensions validated prior to deployment.


#### 3. Which is the most valuable outcome you personally get from it?

A framework for understanding software architecture through architectural styles, including a consistent set of terminology for describing software architecture. Also, a classification of architectural styles for network-based application software by the architectural properties they would induce when applied to the architecture for a distributed hypermedia system.

#### 4. How could you implement it in your own practice as a software developer?

By relying on the knowledge obtained above when developing new software but also when I need to learn about existing software. Also, that guidelines are there as a help not as rules.
